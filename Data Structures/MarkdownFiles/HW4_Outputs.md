## Homework 4 Sample Outputs



**Below are sample outputs for both parts of Homework #4:**



    First is the output of the Span.cpp source file, where the span of Intel's stock price is measured week by week over a three month period. This program could be further generalized by allowing input via .CSV file parsing for stock data, but as it is outside the scope of this project, I opted to manually input weekly data values taken from Yahoo Finance over a 12-week period from August 1, 2023 to October 31, 2023.

    Next is the output for the linked list based queue. This program uses the templated doubly linked list implementation from Homework #3 to implement the queue abstract data type and its `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` functions for an integer type queue.
