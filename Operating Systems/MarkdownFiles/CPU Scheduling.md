### Operating Systems

##### CPU Scheduling

- System is constantly cycling between *CPU bursts* and *I/O bursts*
  
  - The *distribution* of CPU bursts is of paramount importance

- The above is a diagram illustrating the flow of different processing states in a CPU schedule

- Which criteria are used for CPU scheduling?
  
  - *CPU Utilization*
  
  - *Throughput*
  
  - *Turnaround time*
  
  - *Waiting time*
  
  - *Response Time*

- In the case of CPU utilization and throughput, the operating system desires a maximized value

- In the case of turnaround, waiting, and response times, the operating system desires a minimized value
