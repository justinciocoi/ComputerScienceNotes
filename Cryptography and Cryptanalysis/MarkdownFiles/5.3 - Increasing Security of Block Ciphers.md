### Increasing the Security of Block Ciphers

****

- Generally speaking, there are two broad methods by which a block cipher which may not be considered secure can be strengthened to conform to modern cryptographic standards
  
  - *Multiple Encryption*, where encryption is conducted multiple times consecutively
  
  - *Key Whitening* 

****

#### 5.3.1: Double Encryption and Meet-in-the-Middle Attack

****

- Let us assume we have a block cipher of key length $\kappa$ bits

- In *double encryption*, plain-text, $x$, is encrypted using key $k_L$, and the resulting cipher-text is encrypted again using a second key $k_R$

- In order to brute force a double encryption, the effective key length would be $2\kappa$ and an exhaustive key search would require $2^\kappa\cdot 2^\kappa=2^{2\kappa}$

- In a *meet-in-the-middle attack*, the attacker can first crack the left hand side, and then the right hand side
  
  - The total complexity here is $2^\kappa+ 2^\kappa=2\cdot2^{\kappa}=2^{\kappa+1}$
  
  - This is barely more complex than breaking the single encryption
  
  - **Attack Phase 1 Table Computation:** For plaintext, $x_1$, compute a lookup table for all pairs $(k_{L,i},z_{L, i})$, where $e_{k_{L,i}}(x_1)=z_{L, i}$, and $i=1, 2, \cdots,2^\kappa$ 
    
    - The $z_{L,i}$ are the intermediate values that occur between the two encryptions
  
  - **Attack Phase 2 Key Matching:** Now, we check all possible keys starting with the all 0 key until we see a collision of two values, i.e. $z_{L,i}=z_{R,j}$
    
    - This means there exists a key pair $(k_{L,i}, k_{R,j})$
    
    - A second plain-text cipher-text pair must be checked since there are multiple possible keys that could do the correct encryption for a single pair

- ***Theorem 5.3.1:*** Given $l$ subsequent encryptions of a block cipher with key length $\kappa$ bits and block size of $n$ bits, as well as $t$ cipher-text, plain-text pairs, $(x_1, y_1), \cdots, (x_t, y_t)$
  
  - The expected number of false keys which encrypt all plain-texts to the corresponding cipher-texts is $2^{l\kappa-tn}$

****

#### 5.3.2: Triple Encryption

****

- Compared to double encryption, *triple encryption* is *far more secure*

- For compatibility in use with certain legacy systems, triple encryption is sometimes done in the form $y=e_{k1}(e_{k2}^{-1}(e_{k3}(x)))$ 
  
  - If $k_1=k_2$, then the operation is essentially the same as single encryption in the form $y=e_{k3}(x)$

- A meet-in-the-middle attack can still occur, as shown below

- The strength of triple encryption can be seen that regardless of which intermediate cipher-text an attacker chooses to compute a lookup table for, the attacker will have to crack a key of double length for one of the sides

- The meet in the middle attack makes triple encryption as secure as an un-attacked double encryption

****

#### 5.3.3: Key Whitening

****

- A simple technique known as *key whitening* makes it possible to make block ciphers such as DES far more resistant to brute-force attacks

- In addition to the standard cipher key, $k$, two *whitening keys*, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are used to $\oplus$-mask the plain-text and cipher-text

- **Formal Definition of Key Whitening for Block Ciphers:** 
  
  - *Encryption:* $y=e_{k, k_1, k_2}(x)=e_k(x\oplus k_1)\oplus k_2$
  
  - *Decryption:* $x=e^{-1}_{k, k_1, k_2}(x)=e^{-1}_k(y\oplus k_2)\oplus k_1$

- Key whitening does not prevent against analytical attacks, but rather works to strengthen ciphers whose key space is too small
  
  - An example of this is DESX
